# Fine-grained-Image-Classification
This project details the creation of a cutting-edge method that merges Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) with Vision Transformers (ViTs) to improve fine-grained image classification accuracy, focusing on datasets such as CUB-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, and FoodX. By integrating a Vision Transformer module with a ConvNext baseline model, this approach achieves a hybrid model that excels in capturing detailed and global image patterns, significantly advancing image classification capabilities.
